<h3>Theracann DZiner VI v6.5.0 :: 17 Apr 2017</h3>
<strong>Hello Theracann Customers,</strong>

Vtiger 6 marks a paradigm shift in code organisation and MVC implementation. vTigress congratulates the Vtiger team for this great leap!! A much needed initiative, and bodes well for the application and its framework.

Theracann 6 or VI as the Romans do, has kept pace with Vtiger 6, and this release features inForm DZiner, a WYSIWYG module property/attribute/behaviour manager within the CRM that allows you to prototype and deploy additional modules within Vtiger, to better model and serve your business requirements of information management.
