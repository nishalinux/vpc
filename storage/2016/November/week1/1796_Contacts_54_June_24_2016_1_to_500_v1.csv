Thank you again for passing our name along to your contact.  Also, we wish you the best in establishing a science degree at RDC.  Per our discussion, we prefer to staff our labs with people who are comfortable and interested in living in smaller centers - away from the large cities.  Therefore, if we can tap into RDC students who share a common interest then we would be happy to find placements for them.

Please keep us posted on your developments.

Cheers :)

We are also exploring the opportunity to offer a science degree at RDC in collaboration with another institution.  This would still take a number of years, but we are hopeful that in three or four years from now we will have some sort of degree program in science.  That would definitely help meet your challenge.

Elke's past work experience included working in the oil patch as a seismic data processing analyst and as a geophysical software developer's assistant. During the all too brief period of being a stay-at-home mom, Elke was very actively involved in volunteer work in complementary health care issues and in environmental issues. As a Director for the former ""Alberta Society for Environmental Housing and Health"" charity, she also did a fair amount of research on ""Sick Building Syndrome"", and on behalf of the Society spent a week visiting the world-renown Dallas Environmental Health Centre. Elke later worked as a desktop-publishing manager for a small scientific journal, and also created and maintained the Journal's Website. ",

As part of optimising Orica?s North American operations it has been decided to close the Seneca Ammonium Nitrate (AN) plant.
Orica will continue to supply customer requirements for ammonium nitrate from its world scale AN facility in Alberta, Canada; from long term purchase and toll arrangements; and from its joint venture Ammonium Nitrate company, Geneva Nitrogen Inc. in Utah.


Estimated closure costs of A$9 million (post tax) and site remediation costs of A$22 million (post tax), after deducting estimated future sale proceeds, will be recognised as individually significant items in Orica?s financial statements for the year ending 30 September 2006. Once remediation is complete the site will be sold.

Hopefully, you're the person I need to speak with 
regarding your ICP torch rebuilds. They're done; we just need to discuss 
shipping & payment. Please call me at 503-348-3024. If it's possible for me 
to use your FedEx or UPS shipper number, that would make things simpler, I 
think. All fees/taxes/etc. due at the border are your 
responsibility.
